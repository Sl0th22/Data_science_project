    "description": "The Data Services Management Console does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script. When a targeted victim, who is already logged in, clicks on the compromised link, the injected script gets executed within the scope of victimï¿½s browser. This potentially leads to an impact on confidentiality and integrity. Availability is not impacted.",
