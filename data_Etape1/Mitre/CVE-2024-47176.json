    "cve": "CVE-2024-47176",
    "description": "CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and `cups-browsed` contains network printing functionality including, but not limited to, auto-discovering print services and shared printers. `cups-browsed` binds to `INADDR_ANY:631`, causing it to trust any packet from any source, and can cause the `Get-Printer-Attributes` IPP request to an attacker controlled URL. When combined with other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2024-47076, CVE-2024-47175, and CVE-2024-47177, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands remotely on the target machine without authentication when a malicious printer is printed to.",
