    "description": "urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3 doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header special or provide any helpers for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the user. However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header and unknowingly leak information via HTTP redirects to a different origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue has been patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5.",
